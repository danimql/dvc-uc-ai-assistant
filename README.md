AI-powered UC Transfer Assistant for DVC

The DVC UC Transfer Assistant is an AI-powered chatbot designed to help Diablo Valley College (DVC) students, focused on Computer Science majors, identify the correct courses required for transfer to top University of California campuses (UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UC San Diego, (and more in the future)).

The system integrates structured prompting, articulation agreements, and a robust backend pipeline to deliver accurate, context-aware, program-specific guidance.

This project was developed as part of an internship with Skyrelis, an agentic-AI and cybersecurity-focused company.
